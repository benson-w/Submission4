Imagine being in a supermarket and being about to queue to pay.
There are c cashiers (imagine c = 10) to choose from
there's a 'feeder' structure from which 
each person chooses which cashier queue to join. 
Just like any queue; enter in back, serve in front
cashier queue allow additional skip
(allow skip to another queue to end if too slow)
Using threads, run a simulation 
write stats to screen/file for later analysis
to see what happens as you adjust any preferences in the skip method
randomize cashier speed
You will want to create a GUI in order to make your simulation easier to visualize
experiment with various strategies
(join fastest queue, join shortest queue)
